Contact me if you would like to setup a similar website or do business.

I am currently in need one of the following:

1. A place to setup shop.

2. A place to call home.

3. Money.

	- I live in America and have financial debt from a longterm lack of 1 & 2. That debt will keep rising like a car parked in America if it is not under control.

	- I prefer to work for money, and my field is technology (IT, computer programming).

	- To purchase Sublime Text so that I can continue to work.

4. A vehicle.

Help with any one of these things, or just poke around at the content on the website.

One thing I can offer to you is a website similar to this one. It does a lot more than meets the eye, supporting live streaming and transactions.

So let's shake hands or some other culturally-accepted proximity greeting if you are just as excited about it as me.

If you want to help with the first need, here is a way: https://c.dup.bz/money
